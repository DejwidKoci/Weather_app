# Weather_app
In this project we create a weather application using the tkiner, timezonefinder, requests pytz and PIL modules.
In the "icons" and "images" folders we have icons to show the current weather and images to visualise our application.
In the app, we can enter our city and then the app will show us weather data in a window.
